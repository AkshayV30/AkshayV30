              CAD Model was re-modeled for jack knife type bus door using
              Siemens NX 9.0 software package prior to perform the desired FEA
              analysis. o Structural Analysis as well as Fatigue Analysis was
              performed on the product which resulted in negligible amount of
              deformation, which concludes that the product has a structural
              stability under normal operating conditions.
